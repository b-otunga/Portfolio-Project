            I studied at Agoro Sare High School and Proceeded to Kenyatta University where I took a BSc. Biochemistry
            degree. Throughout my childhoold, I have admired computers and elctronics, how they work and how they are
            programmed. This passion has remained with me even though I took a life sciences degree. I still believe
            that technology is the main way of solving world problems like hunger, drought, and global warming.
