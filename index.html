            I am a learning software developer who is generally passionate about
            technology. I am currenly learning Software Engineering at Moringa School. I have learnt about Git, Github,
            HTML, CSS, and Grid Box. This project is to practice the above skills. Using VS Code as my editor, I experiment with various styling features and compare outputs. Read further to know more about me.

            <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
            I studied at Agoro Sare High School and proceeded to Kenyatta University where I took a BSc. Biochemistry
            degree. Throughout my childhood, I have admired computers and electronics, how they work and how they are
            programmed. This passion has remained with me even though I took a life sciences degree. I still believe
            that technology is the main way of solving world problems like hunger, drought, and global warming.
