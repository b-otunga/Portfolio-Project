    I studied at Agoro Sare High School and Proceeded to Kenyatta University where I took a BSc. Biochemistry degree. Throughout my childhoold, I have admired computers and elctronics, how they work and how they are programmed. This passion has remained with me even though I took a life sciences degree. I still believe that technology is the main way of solving world problems like hunger, drought, and global warming.</div>
